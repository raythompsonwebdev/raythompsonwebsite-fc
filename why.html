          <p>
            because it would be an opportunity to gain hands on experience of
            working in software development within an enviroment that provides
            support and learning opportunities. I am particularly interested in
            learning more about agile methologies and seeing how they are
            applied to software development, learning ways to solve complex
            problems and working along side a team to deliver features and add
            value to a team.

            I do have a passion for coding and web development and have obtained
            years of useful experience in the provision of high standard service
            and business support to a diverse range of customers in various work
            environments, including local government revenues and benefits and
            public sector customer service.

            I am an active learner whose technological skills are at a
            proficient level and I am confident in the use of various software
            applications, coding languages, as well as various in-house systems
            and databases. I code in my spare time in the evenings and at
            weekends and during the day when I am temporarily out of work. I
            practice building websites and web applications using languages
            HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP and MySQL.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am keen to utilise my acquired skills and knowledge in
            achallenging position within an organisation like Expedia that
            encourages staff development and inclusion.
